# dolus
#### April Fools 2021

Are you a system admin? Do you want to prank your fellow team mates for April Fool's day? Look no further!
1. Download the dolus bash script
1. Install it on a common server, your team mates computer, etc. using the ``install`` command
1. Get your team mates to run ``dolus`` with any argument suitable for your pretext, e.g. ``dolus -du`` to analyze disk usage.
1. Alternatively, make them run ``dolus`` using ``./``
1. Have fun :wink:
